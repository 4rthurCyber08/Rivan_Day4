## Network Automation
*From Shell Scripting to Automation management tools.*

Shell scripting
Output Hello
~~~
@linux
nano hello.sh

///Edit hello.sh
echo "hello world"
///

chmod 500 hello.sh
./hello.sh
~~~


Create Multi users
~~~
@linux
nano add_user.sh

///add_user.sh
adduser m_user1
echo "m_user1:C1sc0123" | chpasswd

adduser m_user2
echo "m_user2:C1sc0123" | chpasswd

adduser m_user3
echo "m_user3:C1sc0123" | chpasswd
///

chmod 500 add_user.sh
./add_user.sh

## Network Orchestration
Multitenancy - One or more clients can be hosted with the same phyhsical or virtual infrastructure
Scalability - Resources can be added and removed as needed to support current workload and task
Workload Movement - Tasks can be migrated to different physical locations to increase efficiency or reduce cost.
On Demand  - Resources are dedicated only when necessary instead of on a premanent
Resiliency - Tasks and data residing on a failed server can be seamlessly migrated to other phhysical resources.

Traditional Networking - Distributed Management
Software Defined Networking - Centralized Management
